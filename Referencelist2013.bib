  abstract = {Thin films of undoped and fluorine-doped tin oxide have been prepared
	on fused silica substrates by a spray pyrolysis technique. Structural,
	optical and electrical properties were studied. Fluorine doping increased
	the degree of crystallinity and preferred orientation as well as
	the figure of merit (23.9 x 10(-3) at 0.5-mu-m). The refractive index,
	n, showed a considerable decrease (2.2-1.85) on fluorine doping.
	The direct allowed transition for fluorine-doped tin oxide was 0.1
	eV higher than that of undoped material.},

  abstract = {{Polycrystalline thin film solar cells on copper indium diselenide
	(CulnSe(2)) and its alloys and cadmium telluride (CdTe) appear to
	be the most promising candidates for large-scale application of photovoltaic
	energy conversion because they have shown laboratory-efficiences
	in excess of 15\%. Heterojunction devices with n-type cadmium sulfide
	(CdS) films show very low minority carrier recombination at the absorber
	grain boundaries and at the metallurgical interface, which results
	in high quantum efficiences. Open circuit voltages of these devices
	are relatively low owing to the recombination in the space charge
	region in the absorber. Further improvements in efficiency can be
	achieved by reducing the recombination current, especially in devices
	based on CulnSe(2) and its alloys. Low-cost manufacturing of modules
	requires better resolution of a number of other technical issues.
	For modules based on CulnSe(2) and its alloys, the role of Na and
	higher deposition rates on device performance need to be better understood.
	In addition, replacing the chemical bath deposition method for CdS
	him deposition with an equally effective, but more environmentally
	acceptable process is needed. For modules based on CdTe, more fundamental
	understanding of the effect of chloride/oxygen treatment and the
	development of more reproducible and manufacturable CdTe contacting
	schemes are necessary.}},

  abstract = {{The sequential pulsed laser deposition technique was used to grow
	highly transparent and c-axis oriented thin films of Si doped ZnO
	on sapphire substrates. On doping with Si, the resistivity of the
	virgin ZnO thin films was found to decrease from similar to 3.0 x
	10(-2) to 6.2 x 10(-4) Omega cm and its bandgap increased from about
	3.28 to 3.44 eV at different doping concentrations. XPES measurements
	revealed that Si predominantly occupies the Zn lattice sites in the
	Si+3 state. The increase in the bandgap of the ZnO films with increasing
	Si concentration was found to be due to the collective effects of
	high carrier concentration induced Burstein-Moss blue shift and bandgap
	narrowing. Efficient photoluminescence (PL) was observed at room
	temperature from these Si doped ZnO films. The bandgaps obtained
	from the PL measurements were found to be Stokes shifted as compared
	with those obtained from the transmission spectra. Si doping of ZnO
	offers the possibility of developing superior transparent conducting
	electrodes for applications such as in display panels, solar cells
	and transparent resistive non-volatile memories.}},

  abstract = {CdSxTe1-x has been used as a model substance to investigate crystal
	growth from the vapour, twinning phenomena and the electrical properties
	of grain boundaries. A self-selecting vapour growth method produced
	solid solutions of CdSxTe1-x (x approximate to 0.067) with compositional
	uniformity of <2% of x (i.e. <0.0013) as determined by x-ray diffraction
	and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The CdSxTe1-x crystals were highly
	twinned. Statistical tests showed that the twin boundaries are spatially
	correlated. A model for twin formation based on nucleation and grain
	size development is proposed. Band bending at grain and twin boundaries
	in CdTe and in CdSxTe1-x was measured using the scanning electron
	microscope remote electron beam induced current technique. Boundaries
	in CdTe have downward band bending, but those in CdSxTe1-x have upward
	band bending. Decoration of grain boundaries with Te inclusions reduced
	the band bending effect in CdTe. It is postulated that the grain
	boundary passivation in CdTe/CdS solar cells is partly caused by
	enrichment of the grain boundaries in CdTe with CdSxTe1-x and partly
	by the Te enrichment that occurs during processing. },

	during deposition is oxygen-rich and also suggested that chlorine
	and hydrogen chloride, which are produced during the deposition reaction,
	influence crystal growth. Detailed electrical, optical and structural
	properties of the material with respect to varying film thickness
	and substrate temperature are presented and discussed. Resistivity
	of the films deposited at 450 degrees C decreased from 6 x 10(-4)
	to 2 x 10(-4) Omega cm, while the mobility increased from 14 to 45
	cm(2) V(-1)s(-1), respectively, when the film thickness was varied
	from 100 to 1650 nm. The carrier concentration was relatively unchanged
	for film thicknesses higher than 200 nm. Optimized SnO2:F films (similar
	to 600 nm) having a resistivity of similar to 6 x 10(-4) Omega cm,
	a carrier mobility of similar to 20 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1), a carrier concentration
	of similar to 8 x 10(20) cm(-13) and a transmittance in excess of
	80% are quite suitable as electrodes for amorphous silicon solar

	from nanocrystallites possessing average radii close to, and substantially
	larger than, the radius of a bound exciton in the corresponding bulk
	semiconductor. Electrodes constituted from crystallites whose radii
	are close to that of a bound exciton exhibit an onset for band gap

	the bulk material. Knowing the absolute energies of band edges, the
	observed increase in band gap energy for electrodes constituted from
	confined nanocrystallites may be partitioned between the conduction
	and valence bands. A subsequent analysis permits determination of
	the effective electron and hole mass in a nanocrystalline film. Most
	notably, it has proved possible to determine, for the first time,

	to TiO2-based TCO, such as a high refractive index, high transmittance

	applications of TiO2-based TCOs, as well as the mechanism of the

	atmosphere. The oxygen-rich bottom layer behaved as a seed layer
	during crystallization of the top layer, resulting in significant
	improvement of crystallinity and reduction of crystallization temperature.
	We obtained TNO polycrystalline films showing a resistivity of 6.4
	x 10(-4) Omega cm and absorption below 10\% in the visible region
	by post-deposition annealing at 400 degrees C. The developed low-temperature

  abstract = {{This paper presents simple but accurate closed form equations for
	Band Gap Narrowing (BGN) for n and p type, Si, Ge, GaAs and Ge(x)Si1-x
	alloys and strained layers. The equations are derived by identifying
	the four components of BGN: exchange energy shift of the majority
	band edge, correlation energy shift of the minority band edge and
	impurity interaction shifts of the two band edges. In the simple
	parabolic band approximation, the BGN is determined by the effective
	masses of the carriers and the relative permittivity of the semiconductor.
	For real semiconductors, known corrections due to anisotropy of the
	bands, due to multi-valleys in a band and due to interactions between
	sub-bands are used. The values of BGN for n Si, n Ge and n and p
	GaAs calculated using this simple formulation agree closely with
	the theoretical values calculated by other authors using advanced
	but complex many body methods and the Random Phase Approximation
	for screening effects. For p Si and p Ge ours appear to be the first
	calculations taking all interactions into account. Experimental values
	of BGN for all semiconductors except for p Ge for which no data could
	be found, are also in very good agreement with our theory. The Fermi
	level for n and p Si and p GaAs is determined using the published
	luminescence data. In heavily doped p type semiconductors, the values
	are found to be considerably smaller than those calculated using
	the known values of the effective density of states. The values of
	apparent BGN for n and p Si and p GaAs calculated using experimentally
	determined Fermi levels are in remarkably good agreement with the
	experimental values derived from device measurements. All results
	are presented in a form which lends itself to numerical computer
	simulation studies.}},

	for the first time by using single crystalline yttria stabilized
	zirconia (YSZ) as substrates. The epitaxial relationship between
	ITO film and YSZ substrate was ITO[100] parallel-to YSZ[100]. By
	comparing the electrical properties of this epitaxial ITO film with
	that of a randomly oriented polycrystalline ITO film grown on a glass
	substrate, neither the large angle grain boundaries nor the crystalline
	orientation were revealed to be dominant in determining the carrier

	a postdeposition annealing treatment. The structural, electrical,
	and optical properties of these films have been investigated as a
	function of target composition, substrate deposition temperature,
	background gas pressure, and film thickness. Films were deposited
	from various target compositions ranging from 0 to 15 wt % of SnO2
	content. The optimum target composition for high conductivity was
	5 wt % SnO2+95 wt % In2O3. Films were deposited at substrate temperatures
	ranging from room temperature to 300 degrees C in O-2 partial pressures
	ranging from 1 to 100 mTorr. Films were deposited using a KrF excimer
	laser (248 nm, 30 ns full width at half maximum) at a fluence of
	2 J/cm(2). For a 150-nm-thick ITO film grown at room temperature
	in an oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr, the resistivity was 4 x 10(-4)
	Omega cm and the average transmission in the visible range (400-700
	nm) was 85%. For a 170-nm-thick ITO film deposited at 300 degrees

	in the refractive index for ITO films can be achieved by raising
	the electron density in the films, which can be obtained by increasing
	the concentration of Sn dopants in the targets and/or increasing
	deposition temperature. Atomic force microscopy measurements of these
	ITO films indicated that their root-mean-square surface roughness
	(similar to 5 Angstrom) was superior to that of commercially available
	sputter deposited ITO films (similar to 40 Angstrom). The PLD ITO

	indate (CdIn2O4) thin films deposited by rf reactive sputtering from
	a Cd-In alloy target. The structural and electrical properties for
	both assputtered and after-annealed thin films were studied as a
	function of the substrate temperatures. The results revealed that
	elevated substrate temperatures favour the formation of CdIn2O4 thin
	films with spinel phase. The electrical properties can be understood
	by a combination of the occupancy of In cations on the tetrahedral
	vacancies in the spinel unit cell at the elevated substrate temperatures
	and the formation of oxygen vacancies originating from off-stoichiometry.
	It can be inferred that the presence of secondary phases in the CdIn2O4
	thin films deposited in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere is responsible
	for their electrical properties. (C) 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &

	sensitized with a thin layer of CdSe have been prepared, using CuSCN
	as hole transporting material. Samples with significantly different

	to model the device discriminating the series resistance, the role
	of the hole conducting material CuSCN, and the interface process.
	Correlating the impedance analysis with the microstructural properties
	of the solar cell interfaces, a good description of the solar cell
	performance is obtained. The use of thick CdSe layers leads to high
	recombination resistances, increasing the open circuit voltage of
	the devices. However, there is an increase of the internal recombination
	in thick light absorbing layers that also inhibit a good penetration
	of CuSCN, reducing the photocurrent. The model will play an important
	role on the optimization of these devices. This analysis could have
	important implications for the modeling and optimization of all-solid

	for the development of cost effective and reliable photovoltaic systems.
	The two key properties of this material are its near ideal band gap
	for photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 1.45eV, and its high optical
	absorption coefficient. Thin film CdTe solar cells are typically
	hetero-junctions with Us being the n-type partner, or window layer.
	Efficiencies as high as 16.5\% have been achieved. In this paper
	we make a physical analysis of the typical CdS/CdTe superstrate solar
	cell, and we show that present record efficiencies are very close
	to the practical efficiency limit for a CdS/CdTe hetero-junction
	cell. We show that a current estimate for the maximum efficiency
	of hetero-junction CdS/CdTe solar cells is around 17.5\%, in contrast
	to old theoretical predictions, which calculate about 30\% efficiencies
	for ideal homo-junction CdTe solar cells. This analysis explains
	why the record efficiency for this kind of cells has been stable
	for the last 10 years, going up by less than 1\% from 15.8\% to only
	16.5\%. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	diffraction studies of the as-deposited films revealed polycrystalline
	films with cubic structure. The effect of heat treatment with or
	without CdCl2 enhances the grain size and improves the crystallinity
	of the films. Moreover, the activation energy decreases upon heat
	treatment with or without CdCl2 for CdTe thin films. The optical
	spectra of CdTe films show interference oscillations indicating the
	good optical quality of these films. The calculated energy gap decreases
	with or without CdCl2 treatments. The current-voltage and capacitance-voltage
	characteristics for dark and illuminated three junction cells are
	measured. By analysing these measurements the different junction
	parameters are obtained and the effect of CdCl2 treatment on the
	performance of the heterojunctions is investigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier

	1.35 x 10(-4) OMEGA cm were formed by low voltage dc magnetron sputtering
	(LVMS) and highly dense plasma-assisted electron beam (EB) evaporation
	using the are plasma generator (HDPE). The structural properties
	of these films were investigated using x-ray diffraction, scanning
	electron microscope, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis,
	in comparison with the films formed by conventional magnetron sputtering
	and EB evaporation, in order to clarify the key factors for low resistivity.
	With decreasing plasma impedance and sputtering voltages from 540
	to 380 V, the resistivity of the films deposited at T(s) = 400-degrees-C
	decreased from 1.92 to 1.34 x 10(-4) OMEGA cm, due mostly to increase
	in the carrier density. This LVMS film showed higher crystallinity
	because of lower damages of high-energy particles during the deposition,
	which might increase the number of electrically active species. For
	HDPE, the film with resistance of 1.23 x 10(-4) OMEGA cm was deposited
	at T(s) = 280-degrees-C, which showed more flat surface morphology
	and less surface segregation of tin than the conventional EB films.},

  abstract = {Tin doped indium oxide (ITO) films are highly transparent in the visible
	region, exhibiting high reflectance in the infrared region, and having
	nearly metallic conductivity. Owing to this unusual combination of
	electrical and optical properties, this material is widely applied
	in optoelectronic devices. The association of these properties in
	a single material explains the vast domain of its applicability and
	the diverse production methods which have emerged. Although the different
	properties of tin doped indium oxide in the film form are interdependent,
	this article mainly focuses on the electrical aspects. Detailed description
	of the conduction mechanism and the main parameters that control
	the conductivity is presented. On account of the large varieties
	and differences in the fabrication techniques, the electrical properties
	of ITO films are discussed and compared within each technique. (C)

	were sputtered from TiO2-, Ti2O3-, and Ti-based targets at various

	targets, highly conductive films showing a resistivity (rho) of similar
	to 3 x 10(-4) Omega cm could be formed without postdeposition treatment.
	In the case of the TNO films formed from the Ti-based target, reductive

	to achieve similar resistivity values. Thus, the use of oxide targets
	is preferable to obtain as-grown transparent conducting TNO films.
	In particular, the Ti2O3-based target is practically advantageous,

	values of the order of 10(-4) Omega cm are achievable. (C) 2009 Elsevier

	The theoretical calculation for BM effect is in good agreement with

	and band-gap renormalization (BGR) effects. Meanwhile, the monotonic
	redshift of the near-band-gap emission detected by PL measurements
