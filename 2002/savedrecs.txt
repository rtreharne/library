AB Fluorine doped In2O3 films were deposited by DC plasma enhanced
   evaporating in CF4/O-2 mixture gases. The effects of F-doping and
   annealing on the electrical and optical properties of the films have
   been investigated. The film resistivity significantly decreased, but
   the transmittance became low due to F-doping. The film transmittance
   can be improved by annealing in the vacuum. The annealing at higher
   temperature is required for higher F-doped amorphous In2O3 films to be
   crystallized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
